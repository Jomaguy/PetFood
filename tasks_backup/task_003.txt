# Description: Create the data model for dog profiles and implement the form for users to input dog information.
# Details:
Design the dog profile data model with properties for breed, age, gender, weight, activity level, and health conditions. Implement a multi-step form for collecting dog profile information. Add form validation using React Hook Form. Include dropdown options for breeds and predefined options for activity levels. Implement client-side validation for all form fields. Create a preview step before submission.

# Test Strategy:
Test form submission with various valid and invalid inputs. Verify that validation works correctly for all fields. Test the multi-step navigation. Ensure the form data is properly structured according to the data model.
